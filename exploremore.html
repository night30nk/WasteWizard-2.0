            <p class="fontsize_">Understanding waste segregation is crucial in modern waste management. Biodegradable waste comprises organic materials 
                that decompose naturally, such as food waste, leaves, and paper. On the other hand, non-biodegradable waste includes 
                materials that do not decompose easily, like plastics, metals, and glass.
                <br>
                Proper separation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste facilitates recycling and effective disposal methods, 
                contributing to a sustainable environment.
